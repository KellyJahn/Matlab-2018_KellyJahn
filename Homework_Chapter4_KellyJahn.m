%% Q 4.2: Indexing, matrices, length and for
%You run an experiment and the data is collected into 
% the following 3D matrix

mat(:,:,1) = [9    16    16    18     4;...
    6    16    11    11     6;...
    10    13     7    12     9; ...
    10     8    19    12     5];

mat(:,:,2) = [17 5 9 9 12; ...
    4 9 4 2 5; ...
    5 6 18 5 12;...
    3 18    20     8    14];

% The rows represent repeated measurements, 
% the columns represent subjects, 
% and the 3rd dimension represents whether the subject 
% had drunk a cup of tea before the experiment.
% So each subject did the experiment 8 times, 
% four times with a cup of tea, four times without.

% a) Find out how many scores there are greater or 
% equal to 15.

numel(find(mat>=15))
%or
length(find(mat>=15))
% b) Find out how many scores greater or equal to 15 
% there were among people who didn�t get the cup of tea.

%If I assume the non-tea-drinking conditions were in the second half of the 3rd
%dimension:

numel(find(mat(21:40)>=15))

%c) Set all the values less than or equal to 4 to NaN.

mat(mat<=4) = NaN
    
% d) Calculate the mean for each subject 
% (not including values less than or equal to 4).
% If you feel very brave do it without using nonanmean from 
% the github account

nanmean(mat)

% e) write a script where you go through each column 
% (subject) of data, and display for each subject
%       (i) how many NaN there are in that subject�s data, and
%       (ii) how many values there are that are greater or equal to 15.

countnan = zeros(4,5,2);
count15=zeros(4,5,2);
for i = 1:4
    for j = 1:5
        for k = 1:2
            if isnan(mat(i,j,k))
                countnan(i,j,k) = 1;
            elseif mat(i,j,k) >= 15;
                count15(i,j,k) = 1;
            end
        end
    end
end
subjectnan = sum(countnan)
subject15 = sum(count15)
% This is the sum for each subject within each condition (tea and no-tea)

for s=1:5
    tmp=squeeze(newmat(:,s,:));
    disp(['Subject = ', num2str(s)]);
    disp(['NaN''s = ', length(find(isnan(tmp(:))))])
    disp(['15''s = ',length(find(tmp(:)>=15))]);
end
    

%% Q 4.3: Logical operations, mod.

% Write a script so that if x is:

 % 0, 2, 4, 6  � etc.  
 % The script prints �x is an even integer�
 
 x=8;
 if rem(x,2)==0
     disp('x is an even integer');
 end

% 1 3 5 7  � etc.  
% The script prints �x is an odd integer�

x=9;
if rem(x,2)~=0
    disp('x is an odd integer')
end

% A positive non-integer (e.g. 3.2)
 % the script prints �x is a positive non-integer�
 
 x=1.9;
 if x > 0 && mod(x,1)~=0
     disp('x is a positive non-integer')
 end
 

% A negative non-integer (e.g. -2.2) 
% the script prints �x is a negative non-integer�

 x=-1.8;
 if x < 0 && mod(x,1)~=0
     disp('x is a negative non-integer')
 end



%% Q 4.4: While

% Write a script that on each loop rolls four dice and
% displays the sum of the four dice. 
% The program should count the number of rolls until
% the sum of the four dice is equal to 20.

count = 1;
roll = randi([1, 6],1,4)
while sum(roll) ~= 20
    disp(sum(roll));
    count = count+1;
    roll = randi([1, 6],1,4);
end
count





%% and for the brave among you (xtra credit)

%this is like bootstrapping

clear all

nsub=100;
% generate a random group of men and women
men=69+randn(nsub, 1)*3;
women=66+randn(nsub, 1)*3;
% calculate the real difference between them
realdiff=mean(men)-mean(women);
% throw all heights into a cauldron.
all=[men ;women];

pc=pctile(all,50);

% calculated the expected distribution of differences in means between men and women with a sample of 20 
% if there was no genuine height difference
for r=1:1000
    % stir the cauldron
    all=all(randperm(length(all)));
    % assume first 20 are men, second 20 are women
    m_men(r)=mean(all(1:nsub)); %mean of fake men
    m_women(r)=mean(all(nsub+1:end)); %mean of fake women
    m_diff(r)=m_men(r)-m_women(r); %mean difference between fake men and women
end

hist(m_diff) %note that it is normal
plot(realdiff)

ttest(men,women) %1 = significantly different; 0 = non-significant

% Modify the code to find out whether the height difference between men and women would be significant 
% with 10 individuals, 20, 100. (in matlab the command is ttest).

%The height differences are NOT significantly different for 10 individuals
% They are significantly different for 20 individuals
%They are NOT significantly different for 100 individuals


% in a group of 100 individuals, of whom 50 were male, 50 female. 
% How many of the 50 tallest people would be female?
