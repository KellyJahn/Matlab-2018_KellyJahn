%% 5.2 Indexing into a linear array in real world coordinates
% Miguel collects data for an EEG experiment.  Each session of data consists of 30 trials, each lasing 5s. 
%The EEG machine records data every 2ms. Strangely his data looks like a perfect sinusoid, with 0 mean normally distributed noise.

ntrials=30;
durtrial=5*1000;
sampRate = 2;

timevec=sampRate:sampRate:durtrial*ntrials; %note: not starting at 0

%timevec=0:2:durtrial*ntrials;
data=sin((2*pi* timevec)/(durtrial))+.1*randn(size(timevec));
figure(7);
plot(timevec, data, '-')

% a) What is the mean response during all the data points that are within the first Â½ second of every trial?

hw5
n = 500;
b = arrayfun(@(i) mean(data(i:i+n-1)),1:2500:length(data)-n+1)';
% so each trial is separated by 2500 (5000ms), b shoul be length 30.

% b) What is the mean response during the interval 2-2.5s of each trial?

n=2000:2500;
b = arrayfun(@(i) mean(data(i:i+n-1)),1:n:length(data)-n+1)'; 
% this is odd, since n is a vector, should it not be
b = arrayfun(@(i) mean(data(i:i+250)),1000:2500:length(data))'; 
=======
timevecTrial = mod(timevec,durtrial);

mean(data(timevecTrial<500))


% b) What is the mean response during the interval 2-2.5s of each trial?

mean(data(timevecTrial<2000 & timevecTrial<2500))


% c) during which timepoints does the EEG response have values greater than 0.9?

idx = find(data > 0.9)

% d) during which timepoints does the EEG response have values between 0.7 and 0.8?

find(data >= 0.7 & data <= 0.8)

% (obviously you will get different answers each time because your data will vary each time).

%% 5.3 Indexing into a matrix using real world coordinates

%Sam Lin collects data on 70 rats. 20 of them were duds and their data were thrown away. 

ratID=randperm(70); ratID=sort(ratID(1:50)); 

%On the remaining rats he collects 10000 trials, and he calculates the % correct across each bin of 100 trials.
ratID=randperm(70); ratID=sort(ratID(1:50)); 
binsteps=1:100:10000;
[X, Y]=meshgrid(1:length(ratID), 1:length(binsteps)); %grid with rats in columns and trials in rows
per=Y+randi(10, size(Y))-5; %rats' scores
per(per>100)=100; per(per<0)=0;

%a) image the rats performance in a matrix with trials along the x axis and rats along the y axis 
%using a colormap that varies between white for 100% correct and black for 0% correct (not using imagesc).

figure(8);
image(binsteps,ratID,per'); colormap(gray(100));
xlabel('Trial');
ylabel('Rat');
colorbar

%b) change the colormap so that values above 90% are white and values below 10% are black.

hw5
figure(9);
cmap=gray(100);
cmap(1:10,:)=0;
cmap(90:100,:)=1;
image(per'); colormap(cmap); % this makes above 80 % white

=======
cmap=gray(100);
cmap(1:10,:)=0;
cmap(91:100,:)=1;
colormap(cmap)


%c) how many rats performed above 66% correct between trials 6001-7001?

subper = per(61:70,:);
meansubper = mean(subper)
sum(meansubper>66)

hw5
perC = per;
perC(find(binsteps>7001), :) = NaN; % each bin has 100 trials and you need to put the Nans in perC
perC(find(binsteps<6001), :) = NaN;
imagesc(perC)
tmp=nanmean(perC, 1);
nrats=length(find(tmp>66));

%d) which rats were they?

find(per(60:70,:) > 66)
ratID(find(tmp>66))

%e) How many trials would be needed for 40/50 rats to be performing above 80%.
per80=per>80;
numover80=sum(per80,2);
minTover80=find(numover80>40);
minTover80(1);
binsteps(minTover80)
=======

%d) which rats were they?
id=meansubper>66
sum(id)
ratID(id)

%e) How many trials would be needed for 40/50 rats to be performing above 80%.

M80 = per>80;
vectrat80 = sum(M80,2); %sum the rows; the number of rats that did better than 80% in that time bin

%find first time that vectrat80>40 and then the number of trials after
%which that occurred

binsteps(min(find(vectrat80>40))) %the number of trials where 40 rats first perform better than 80%


%f) It turns out that for the rats with even ID numbers (2, 4, 6 10 etc.) the recording machine was on the blink for an interval between the 5678th trial and the 7533rd trial. Convert those numbers to NaN.
per( 56:76, find(mod(ratID,2)==0))=NaN;

=======
badRats = ~mod(ratID,2); %list of 50 numbers for which when they are 1, the ID is an even number
badBins = 56:76;
per(badBins, badRats) = NaN;
